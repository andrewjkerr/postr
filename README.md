About

Problem: Keeping up with constant updates from friends/family
Solution: Postr

Postr is a temporary social media site where each user can only have one post at a time. This post is automatically erased when another post is published by that user. A post can be text or a picture (more to be added later) and each post will not be archived so once another post is published, the previous post will be erased indefinitely.

Each post will have a comment system that will allow for replies and recommends. This will enable users to create a meaningful conversation on a post. Users will also be able to 'like' posts.

Postr will give users the ability to follow others, but a userâ€™s followers will only be available to that user (in a future update.) Who a user follows will also be kept to only that user. Any posts made by another user that the current user follows will show up on the Postr feed.
